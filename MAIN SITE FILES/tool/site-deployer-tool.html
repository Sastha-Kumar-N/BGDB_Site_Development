          <h1>Objective</h1>
          <p>Our primary objective was to create an installation script capable of setting up a biological database management system using Tripal 3 on Debian Linux version 11 efficiently. We aimed to address the shortcomings encountered during our initial deployment attempts, providing a solution that could be expanded to accommodate newer Tripal versions, other similar tools and diverse Linux distributions in the future. We also focused on making it user-friendly so as to help bridge the gap between biologists and bioinformaticians.</p>

          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>Posted by <a href="#">Admin</a></p>
          <p>This project focuses on the development of an installation script that sets up a Biological Database Management System and an accompanying website for use by biologists and bioinformaticians. The script, written in the Bash scripting language and utilizing the Whiptail program for graphical user input, addresses challenges encountered during the setup of our website, BharatGenomeDatabase.org. Our objective was to streamline the deployment of the system, overcoming compatibility issues such as the selection of multiple PHP versions and various Tripal dependencies. The script not only successfully achieves this goal but also includes provisions for user-configurable parameters, such as the choice of components to install. Some notable components include Tripal extensions like Tripal Blast and Tripal JBrowse, which are not only installed but also configured with example data. This script serves as a foundational tool that can be expanded in the near future by adding more features, such as the ability to deploy newer bioinformatics tools and support for using other Linux distributions as the base. Our project underscores the significance of user-friendliness in implementing bioinformatics tools, aiming to provide biologists, particularly those with limited technical expertise, a seamless entry into this emerging era of biological advancement.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Good luck and I hope you find the tool useful!</p>

        <h3>Image and text</h3>
        <p> <a href="#"><img src="images/firefox-gray.jpg" width="100" height="121" alt="firefox-gray"  class="float-left" /></a> To achieve our objective, we extensively studied the Linux environment, mainly Debian Linux as it ws the most popular, in order to understand the root causes of issues we faced in relation to PHP versions and Tripal dependencies. With the knowledge we gained, we started the creation of the deployment script, which primarily uses 'bash' scripting language.
- We opted for bash due to its seamless command-line integration, capacity for customization, flexibility, and, notably, its default presence on the majority of Linux systems.
- Since bash is basically a command-line program and not the most user-friendly when it comes to new-to-linux biologists, we needed a way to make the execution of script visually understandable and followable to them. For that we chose a program called whiptail.
- It's job is to display some colorful graphics in the linux command-line which is generally some white text in black background. Whiptail gets called in multiple parts of the installation for achieving two main tasks. One is to to give a visual confirmation when taking user inputs because the output in other parts of the script was too plain. Second is to provide instructions to the user when user interaction is necessary. 
- We separated the single install sctipt that we drafted at the beginning of the work into modules and modified each module script to allow them to be used independently allowing users who want only a particular feature to take that particular script and execute to get that. Eg: To setup tripal daemon in an already existing tripal system, the user only need to run install-tripal-daemon.sh script.
- Another challenge that we needed to solve was that tripal, during it's initial setup requires a connection to be established to raw.githubusercontent.com. That is where its initial configuration data is stored which needs to be retrieved to local machine. But here in India, a lot of ISPs are blocking this open source website url. Hence we needed to incorporate a warning in the script by detecting this issue programmatically.
- Some tripal modules like tripal_daemon and field_formatter_settings needed to be patched with fixes for some unexpected issues which were not officially incorporated into their respective packages atleast for tripal 3 and drupal 7.
