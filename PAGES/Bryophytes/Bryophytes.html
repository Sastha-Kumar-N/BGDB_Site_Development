      <h3><strong>Bryophytes </strong></h3>
	
      <p style="color: black;">Bryophytes, a diverse group of non-vascular plants, represent a fascinating and ancient lineage in the plant kingdom. Comprising mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, bryophytes are characterized by their lack of true roots, stems, or leaves, and they primarily reproduce via spores rather than seeds. Despite their relatively simple structure, bryophytes play essential ecological roles. They colonize a wide range of habitats, from lush rainforests to arid deserts, and serve as pioneers in ecological succession, helping to stabilize soils and create suitable conditions for other plant species to thrive. Additionally, bryophytes are important indicators of environmental health, as their sensitivity to pollution and habitat changes makes them valuable tools for monitoring ecosystem conditions. These unassuming plants offer invaluable insights into the evolution and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and continue to captivate botanists and ecologists worldwide.</p>

      <h4>Marchantia polymorpha&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;Marchantia polymorpha is a liverwort species with a wide distribution, including various regions of India. Liverworts are non-vascular plants that typically grow in damp and shady locations. Marchantia polymorpha is easily recognizable by its flattened, lobed thallus (the plant's vegetative body).</p>

      <h4>Funaria hygrometrica</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;Funaria hygrometrica is a common moss species found not only in India but also across the globe. It is characterized by its vibrant green appearance and distinctive capsule (spore-bearing structure) that is raised on a long stalk.</p>

      <h4>Polytrichum commune</h4>
      <p>Polytrichum commune is a common moss species found in India, particularly in moist woodland areas. It is known for its tall and erect growth habit, with long, upright stems covered in green leaves. This moss plays a role in retaining moisture in the forest floor and contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem</p>

      <h4>Marchantia nepalensis</h4>
      <p>Marchantia nepalensis is a liverwort species native to India, where it can be found in moist terrestrial habitats. Like other liverworts, it has a flattened thallus and is adapted to grow in damp, shaded areas. Marchantia nepalensis, like other liverworts, plays a role in soil stabilization and provides a suitable microhabitat for various microorganisms. Its presence contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment.</p>

      <h4>Riccia fluitans</h4>
      <p>Riccia fluitans is another liverwort species found in aquatic habitats in India. Unlike many other liverworts, Riccia fluitans is adapted to floating on the water's surface. It often forms dense mats in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. These mats provide shelter and substrate for various aquatic organisms, making Riccia fluitans ecologically significant in these habitats..</p>
